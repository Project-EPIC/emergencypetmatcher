			<h1>Studying Social Sharing</h2>
			<p>Thanks for your interest in our study.  As part of our class project, we have decided to study various aspects of the behavior of social sharing via a method called "experience sampling".
We appreciate your participation in this study.</p>
			<h2>Who's running this study?</h2>
			<p>We are students at the University of Colorado.  Please feel free to contact us at the addresses provided below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Joshua Barron, University of Colorado (joshua.barron AT colorado.edu)</li>
				<li>Tyler Howarth, University of Colorado (tyler.howarth AT colorado.edu)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What do I have to do?</h2>
			<p>After consenting to the terms of the study via the form below, you'll download a Google Chrome extension that will immediately ask you 
for your e-mail address.  Please use your actual e-mail address - this is how we internally identify various participants and contact you if we need to update the extension 
or ask you for a post-study survey response.  Don't worry, we won't give out this e-mail address or spam you!</p>
			<p>After typing in your e-mail address, all you need to do is go about your normal business.  Occasionally, when you share an item to your Facebook profile (like a YouTube video), you'll get a little
notification asking you to fill out a brief survey about that action (this is known as "experience sampling").  Please fill out this survey and continue on - each survey should only take a minute to complete at the most.</p>
			<h2>What do I get?</h2>
			<p>Apart from the warm fuzzy feeling of helping two college students out, we will be providing incentives for the participants of this study.  We will be giving away three (3) $10 iTunes gift cards
away to three randomly selected participants in the study.  At our discretion, we may award up to three additional $10 iTunes gift cards to outstanding participants.  Your odds of winning are approximately 1 in 10, but this figure is based off having
thirty people in our study.  Since the study is open to the public, this figure may be higher or lower depending on the final study population.</p>
			<h2>The Fine Print</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>You must be a user of Google Chrome and of Facebook to be a participant in this study.</b></li>
				<li>Participation in this study is totally voluntary.  You may discontinue your partcipation at any time, without notice.  To uninstall the Google Chrome plugin, open your Extensions menu
(Tools -> Extensions) and remove the "SS2: ESM Notifications" entry.</li>
				<li>Completion of the prompted surveys is also totally voluntary.  While we appreciate having more data, if you don't want to fill out a survey about something you shared, please don't feel obligated to do so.</li>
				<li>In order to be eligible to receive one of the iTunes gift cards, you must: </li>
					<ul>
						<li>provide a valid e-mail address (so we can contact you!)</li>
						<li>be a participant for the duration of the study (this study ends on March 31, 2012)</li>
						<li>complete a post-study survey, if we contact you to do so</li>
					</ul>
				<li>After we complete this study and reward the iTunes gift cards, we will destroy all personally identifiable information in the collected data.  The data collected will never be made public.</li>
				<li><b>By downloading and installing the Chrome extension, you agree to these terms.</b></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>So where do I sign up?</h2>
			<p>Simply agree to the terms above by clicking this check box and then hit the "Download" button to download and install the experience sampling extension.  Thank you for your participation!</p>
			<input type="checkbox" name="consent" id="consentBox">I agree to the listed terms and conditions of the study and agree to participate.
